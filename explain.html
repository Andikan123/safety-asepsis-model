      <h1>Explaination and Answers to the Question</h1>
      <p>
        1.Correct Correct Answer: A. Safety guidelines The nurse always should
        reinforce safety guidelines when teaching parents how to care for their
        children. By giving anticipatory guidance the nurse can help prevent any
        accidental injuries. When possible, an age-appropriate diet and fluids
        should be continued. Oral rehydration therapy using a commercial
        pediatric oral rehydration solution is the preferred approach to mild or
        moderate dehydration. • Option B: Because surgery is not a treatment for
        gastroenteritis, this topic is inappropriate. The management of acute
        gastroenteritis is directed at preventing or treating the dehydration
        that so often accompanies this disease. • Option C: Toilet training is
        too early for an 8-month old infant. Most children begin to show signs
        of readiness for toilet training when they’re between 18 and 24 months
        old, though some may not be ready until later than that. And boys often
        start later and take longer to learn to use the potty than girls. •
        Option D: For parents of an 8-month-old infant, it is too early to
        discuss nursery schools. Most preschools start accepting kids around the
        age of 2.5 to 3 years old, but since every child is different, this
        isn’t a magic number. Preschool readiness really depends more on
        developmental factors than chronological age.

        2.Correct Answer: B. 12 months The nurse should start screening a child
        for lead poisoning at age 12 months and perform repeat screening at age
        24, 30, and 36 months. The Advisory Committee on Childhood Lead
        Poisoning Prevention recommends that all children enrolled in Medicaid
        be screened for elevated blood lead levels at 12 and 24 months of age or
        at 36 to 72 months of age if they have not previously been screened. •
        Option A: High-risk infants, such as premature infants and formula-fed
        infants not receiving iron supplementation, should be screened for iron
        deficiency anemia at 6 months. Early use and overuse of cow’s milk
        exacerbates existing causes of iron deficiency in infants. Less often,
        the problem is due to a severe blood loss or something interfering with
        the body’s ability to absorb iron, such as a medication the infant is
        taking or a chronic illness involving the stomach or intestines. •
        Option C: The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that a
        risk assessment be performed for lead exposure at well-child visits at 6
        months, 9 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, and at 3, 4, 5, and 6
        years of age. A blood lead level test should be done only if the risk
        assessment comes back positive. • Option D: The American Academy of
        Pediatrics (AAP), as part of an expert committee representing several
        national healthcare organizations, makes the following recommendation:
        routine obesity screening of children aged 2 years old or older should
        include a yearly assessment of weight. BMI changes should be monitored
        by calculating and plotting BMI on the Centers for Disease Control and
        Prevention (CDC) growth charts at every healthcare visit

        3.Correct Answer: A. Tachypnea The body compensates for metabolic
        acidosis via the respiratory system, which tries to eliminate the
        buffered acids by increasing alveolar ventilation through deep, rapid
        respirations. As the body attempts to compensate for worsening acidosis,
        the respiratory rate increases to reduce the pCO2 and maintain a
        compensated physiological pH.

        4.Correct Answer: D. “Our child must maintain these dietary restrictions
        lifelong.” Celiac disease is an autoimmune reaction to a protein called
        gluten. A patient with celiac disease must maintain dietary restrictions
        lifelong to avoid recurrence of clinical manifestations of the disease.
        A gluten-free diet should be followed by avoiding barley, rye, wheat,
        oats, and triticale. Once the diagnosis of celiac disease is made,
        patients need regular follow up to ensure that they are compliant with a
        gluten-free diet and not developing any complications.

        5.• ANS: D Allowing a car to run in the garage introduces carbon
        monoxide into the environment and decreases the available oxygen for
        human consumption. Garages should be opened and not just cracked to
        allow fresh air into the space and allay this concern. Checking the
        chimney and heater, changing the batteries on the detector, and
        following up on symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, and fatigue are all
        statements that would indicate that the individual has understood the
        education.

        6. The answer is C. To confirm you have the right patient the nurse
        needs to use at least two patient identifiers. Full name and birthday is
        sufficient
      </p>
      <p>
        7 The answer is C. The nurse checked the Right Medication and Right
        Dosage. Due to this safety check of the medication administration
        rights, the nurse should note that the medication on hand is not the
        same medication ordered. The medication names are very similar:
        acetaZOLAMIDE (diuretic) acetoHEXAMIDE (treats diabetes and helps lower
        blood glucose) 3. The doctor writes an order
      </p>
      <p>
        8.The answer is C. Two tablets should be administered and the nurse is
        checking the right dosage.
      </p>
      <p>
        9.The answer is D: INR result. Prior to administering Warfarin (which is
        an anticoagulant), the nurse must make it priority to assess the INR
        result and confirm it is within parameters before administering the
        medication
      </p>
      10.The answer is D: Right Patient is missing. The nurse needs to confirm
      they have the right patient for these medications. The first 5 Rights of
      Medication Administration include: Right Patient, Right Medications, Right
      Doses, Right Time, and Right Route
